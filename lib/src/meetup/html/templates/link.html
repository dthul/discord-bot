    <h2>Connect your Meetup and Discord profiles</h2>
    <p>
        Most SwissRPG games have a private channel on Discord where you can
        discuss with the Game Master and other players, get information
        about the adventure, create your character before the game and ask
        questions. In order to give you access to the Discord channels of
        the games you register to, we need to connect your Meetup and
        Discord profiles.
